In this document I tested which characters are escaped in Freeplane.

Test data, input into Freeplane:

  ~!@#$%^&*()_+
  `1234567890-=
  
  {}|
  []\
  
  :"
  ;'
  
  <>?
  ,./
  
How it rendered in the .mm file as text:

  ~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+
  `1234567890-=
  
  {}|
  []\
  
  :&quot;
  ;&apos;
  
  &lt;&gt;?
  ;,./"
