These are mindmaps, trees of text. 

It only takes five commands to navigate in them. Those commands are: up, down, left, right and spacebar. The spacebar unfolds|shows or folds|hides the contents of a branch. Contents can be thought of as children, branching off from the parent.

I use shorthand, because it lets me fit more words on the screen. If the meaning of the shorthand used in a node is not obvious, its children likely include a disambiguation node (usually blue, and often preceded by an = sign), which can be revealed by unfolding the ambiguous node.

You'll need to install one thing -- Freeplane (which is free and available for Linux, Mac and Windows), Freemind or some other mindmap editor that recognizes the .mm format.
