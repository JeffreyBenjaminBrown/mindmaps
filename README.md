These are mindmaps, trees of text. 

They are easy to read -- it only takes five commands! They are up, down, left, right and spacebar. The spacebar unfolds|shows or folds|hides the contents of a branch.

You'll need to install one thing -- Freeplane (which is free and available for Linux, Mac and Windows), Freemind or some other mindmap editor that recognizes the .mm format.
