These are mindmaps, trees of text.

Getting your computer to display one of these mindmaps
------------------------------------------------------
You will need to install a mindmap application that recognizes the .mm format. I suggest Freeplane -- it's simple, powerful, popular, free, and available for Linux, Mac and Windows.

Once you've got a mindmap app, you'll need to download a mindmap and open it from your own computer. The simplest way is this:

  (1) Point your browser to one of the mindmaps. (If you are reading this Readme file from your browser, you can go to one of the mindmaps, e.g. the one called go.mm, by clicking on the hyperlink titled "go.mm" at the top of the page.)

  (2) The resulting page should look mostly like gibberish, because it is designed to be read by Freeplane, not a human. However, it will have a button called Raw at the top right corner. Click there, and you'll be brought to a plain text page, again mostly gibberish. Save that file to your hard drive.

  (3) Find the file on your hard drive, and click on it.

Reading one of the mindmaps, as a human
---------------------------------------
It only takes five commands to navigate around a file in Freeplane. Those commands are: up, down, left, right and spacebar. The spacebar unfolds|shows or folds|hides the contents of a branch. Contents can be thought of as children, branching off from the parent.

I use shorthand, because it lets me fit more words on the screen. If the meaning of the shorthand used in a node is not obvious, its children likely include a disambiguation node (usually blue, and often preceded by an = symbol), which can be revealed by unfolding the ambiguous node.
